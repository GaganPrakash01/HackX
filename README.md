Project title : Artzy : A NFT marketplace for local artists

Introduction :

Local artists are struggling to make a living in this present era of technology. Their artworks are exemplary but computer generated art is easier to port and in demand.
Hence to uplift local artists and and refuel their passion, ‘Artzy ‘ takes up the center stage. Every artwork that the artist creates can be published as an NFT with some value.


Solution:

Artists create their artwork and publish them as an NFT on the web application. They set a base value of their own NFTs and then they are open to be traded.
Other users can trade artworks of their liking and own them for a certain price. Hence each time an artwork is traded , the artist gets 5% of the traded amount as royalty.
Hence the artists are able to showcase their work and build a network with the outside world. The royalties give them the much needed financial aid for their talent.
